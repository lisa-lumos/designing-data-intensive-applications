# 3. Storage and Retrieval
On the most fundamental level, a database needs to do two things: when you give it some data, it should store the data, and when you ask it again later, it should give the data back to you. From the database’s point of view: how we can store the data that we’re given, and how we can find it again when we’re asked for it. In order to tune a storage engine to perform well on your kind of workload, you need to have a rough idea of what the storage engine is doing under the hood. In particular, there is a big difference between storage engines that are optimized for transactional workloads and those that are optimized for analytics.
