# 12. The future of data systems
Every piece of software, even a so-called “general-purpose” database, is designed for a particular usage pattern. 

Even if you perfectly understand the mapping between tools and circumstances for their use, there is another challenge: in complex applications, data is often used in several different ways. There is unlikely to be one piece of software that is suitable for all the different circumstances in which the data is used, so you inevitably end up having to cobble together several different pieces of software in order to provide your application’s functionality.

Derived views allow gradual evolution. If you want to restructure a dataset, you do not need to perform the migration as a sudden switch. Instead, you can maintain the old schema and the new schema side by side as two independently derived views onto the same underlying data. You can then start shifting a small number of users to the new view in order to test its performance and find any bugs, while most users continue to be routed to the old view. Gradually, you can increase the proportion of users accessing the new view, and eventually you can drop the old view.
