# 12. The future of data systems
Every piece of software, even a so-called “general-purpose” database, is designed for a particular usage pattern. 

Even if you perfectly understand the mapping between tools and circumstances for their use, there is another challenge: in complex applications, data is often used in several different ways. There is unlikely to be one piece of software that is suitable for all the different circumstances in which the data is used, so you inevitably end up having to cobble together several different pieces of software in order to provide your application’s functionality.
